Browser-based Multiplayer Games with tap.io
===========================================
Platform for building browser-based, distributed simulations/games. This is all possible thanks to the recent 
explosion of innovation in browser technology, including WebSockets, WebGL, and socket.io.

Tap.io systems use socket.io for communication. They can use anything (WebGL, canvas, jQuery) to render the game.

See the rest of [the documentation](http://github.com/0x0539/tap.io/src).
