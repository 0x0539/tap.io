RNG Test
========
This application demonstrates the shared random number generator. It shows that you can add
the state of the random number generator into the distributed state and generate the same
sequence of pseudorandom numbers from each machine in the system.

Running the Example
===================
1. Install node. 
2. Run `npm install tap.io`. 
3. Run `node app.js`.
4. Open `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser.
