RNG Test
========
This application demonstrates the shared random number generator. It shows that you can add
the state of the random number generator into the distributed state and generate the same
sequence of pseudorandom numbers from each machine in the system. You can run this example
by cloning this repository and from this directory running:

```
npm install
node app.js
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
