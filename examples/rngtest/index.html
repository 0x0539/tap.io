    <p>Check your JS console. You will see an output stream in the following format:</p>
    <pre>    vt: rand</pre>
    <p>The first number, <i>vt</i>, is the virtual time when the message was printed. The second number, <i>rand</i>, is a random number
    generated by a distributed random number generator. Its state is folded into the shared state of the system so that many machines 
    can deterministically generate the same sequence of random numbers.</p>
    <p>To confirm that this is the case, run the server for a little while. Note that it outputs the same stream of numbers.  
    Now connect with a client. You should see that where the <i>vt</i>'s are the same, so are the <i>rand</i>'s.</p>
