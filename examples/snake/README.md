Snake
=====
This is an implementation of the Snake game. It's pretty unpolished at the moment but
you can run it yourself. Just clone this repository and from the game root, run

```
npm install
node app.js
```

That should start a server on port 8080. Once running, you can play the game at 
http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
